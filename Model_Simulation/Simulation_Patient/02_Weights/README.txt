In the folder of IntialWeights:
15 sets of random weights were used to train the sighted  versions of the lesion simulations 
These weights need to be in the same folder of the files of model specification in order to run the training scripts

In the folder of TrainedWeights:
Trained to criterion weights were saved for sighted models and later used for lesion procedures.
