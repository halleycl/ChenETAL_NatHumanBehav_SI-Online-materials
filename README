Code Availability.
The scripts used for ROI warping, group-averaged map, and thresholding in the tractography analysis can be found in the following folder: /ProbabilisticTractography/ProbTractography_Output/. The model architecture specifications, training and testing procedure scripts in LENS can be found in the following folder: /Model_Simulation/Simulation_fMRI/01_Model_Specification/ for fMRI simulation for simulating fMRI results, and in /Model_Simulation/Simulation_Patient/01_Model_Specification/ for simulating the patients' behaviors. In each of above folder, please refer to the README.txt files for detailed instructions of how to run these scripts.

Data Availability. 
Specifically, coordinates used in the meta-analysis and the complete reference list of papers used in the meta-analysis can be found in the folder  /ALE-meta_analysis. ROI files in MNI space can be found in the folder /ProbabilisticTractography/ROIs/, and the output files of connectivity measures of each subject from PICo can be found in the folder /ProbabilisticTractography/ProbTractography_Output/. Additionally, the final connectivity matrix and ROI look-up table can be found in the folder /ProbabilisticTractography/. Initial weights and trained weights for model simulations can be found in the folder /02_Weights/ under both directories /Model_Simulation/Simulation_fMRI/ and /Model_Simulation/Simulation_Patient/. Model output files are under the folder /03_Output/ under both directories /Model_Simulation/Simulation_fMRI/ and /Model_Simulation/Simulation_Patient/. Please also refer to the README.txt files to see details about these data.
